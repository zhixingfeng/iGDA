.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smyrna
[
.B \-v?
]
[ 
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B smyrna
is a viewer for graphs in the DOT format.
It is especially designed to handle large graphs, and
allows flat and topological fisheye views.
It is assumed the input graph has position information
associated with all nodes. Using the Graphviz convention,
a node's position is given by its \fIpos\fP attribute
consisting of 2 or 3 floating point numbers separated by commas.
Nodes are drawn as points and edges as line segments.
.P
If \fBsmyrna\fP detects that the file contains \fIxdot\fP 
attributes, it will use this information when drawing nodes
and edges.
.P
\fBsmyrna\fP supports panning and zooming; node and edge selection;
setting and retrieving node and edge attributes, especially colors;
and node movement.
The Smyrna Settings dialogue box available under the Edit pull-down
menu gives the user many choices for tailoring the graph view. These
include whether or not nodes/edges are drawn; what labels are 
associated with nodes/edges; node size; transparency settings for
nodes/edges; parameters associated with the topological fisheye view.
.P
For the purposes of exploratory data analysis, \fBsmyrna\fP provides
access to the \fBgvpr\fP library. This allows the user to arbitrarily
query, filter or manipulate a graph. When filtering or manipulating
a graph, the user has the option of performing the changes directly
on the input graph, or to create a new version with the changes. 
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-?
Print usage information.
.LP
By default, 
.I gc
returns the number of nodes and edges.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I file
Name of file containing a graph in DOT format.
If no
.I file
operand is specified,
the user can employ the File pull-down menu to select a file
to be opened.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values are returned:
.TP 4
.B 0
Successful completion.
.TP
.B 1
If no No appropriate OpenGL-capable visual found,
or if the default attributes template graph file or
the default attributes widget graph file could not be read.
.SH "FILES"
\fBsmyrna\fP relies on numerous support files. These are 
usually installed in the "share/graphviz/smyrna" directory
below the installation root. The principal files are:
.TP
.I template.dot
A file in DOT format specifying the default \fBsmyrna\fP settings.
In particular, these are used to initialize the settings of the
Smyrna Settings dialogue box. 
.TP
.I mouse_actions.txt
A text file specifying the mapping of concrete mouse and keyboard
events with \fBsmyrna\fP actions such as panning and selecting.
.TP
.I attr_widgets.dot
A file in DOT format specifying the bindings between GUI widgets
and \fBsmyrna\fP parameters.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B SMYRNA_PATH
allows a user to override the built-in path to the directory
containing all of \fBsmyrna\fP's files described above.
