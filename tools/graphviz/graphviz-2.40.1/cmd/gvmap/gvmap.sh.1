.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gvmap.sh
takes as input a graph in DOT format, performs a layout, runs the output through
gvmap and renders the output. At some point, it is hoped to integrate all of these
tasks into gvmap.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-a " k"
The integer k specifies the average number of artificial points added along 
the bounding box of the labels. Such artificial points are added to avoid 
a country boundary cutting through the boundary box of the labels. Computing 
time is proportional to k; hence, for large graphs, a small value of k is 
suggested. If k = -1, a suitable value of k is automatically selected based on 
the graph size. By default k = -1.
.TP
.BI \-K " layout" 
specifies which program should be use for the initial layout. By default,
sfdp is run. Also by default, the layout is passed the flag -Goverlap=prism. This can be
overridden using a -g flag.
.TP
.BI \-T " format" 
specifies the final output format. This works the same way as the -T flag for any
Graphviz layout program.
.TP
.BI \-N " attr=val"
specifies the setting of a default node attribute during the rendering phase. This works the same way as 
the -N flag for any Graphviz layout program.
.TP
.BI \-G " attr=val"
specifies the setting of a graph attribute during the rendering phase. This works the same way as 
the -G flag for any Graphviz layout program.
.TP
.BI \-E " attr=val"
specifies the setting of a default edge attribute during the rendering phase. This works the same way as 
the -E flag for any Graphviz layout program.
.TP
.BI \-n " attr=val"
specifies the setting of a default node attribute during the layout phase. This works the same way as 
the -N flag for any Graphviz layout program.
.TP
.BI \-g " attr=val"
specifies the setting of a graph attribute during the layout phase. This works the same way as 
the -G flag for any Graphviz layout program.
.TP
.BI \-e " attr=val"
specifies the setting of a default edge attribute during the layout phase. This works the same way as 
the -E flag for any Graphviz layout program.
.TP
.BI \-A " flag"
specifies a flag to be passed to gvmap. For example, gvmap.sh -Ae -As3 causes gvmap -e -s3 to be run.
.TP
.BI \-v
Set verbose mode.
.TP
.BI \-V
Print version information and exit. 
.TP
.BI \-?
Print usage information and exit. 

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following invocation
creates a map with edges in semi-transparent light gray and nodes laid 
out using sfdp:
.PP
gvmap.sh -Ae -Ecolor=#55555522 -Tpng foo.gv > foo.png
.PP
It is equivalent to running the pipeline
.PP
sfdp -Goverlap=prism foo.gv | gvmap -e | neato -n2 -Ecolor=#55555522 -Tpng > foo.png
