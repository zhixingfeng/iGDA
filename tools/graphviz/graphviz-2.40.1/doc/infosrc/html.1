<H2><A NAME=html>HTML-Like Labels</A></H2>

<B>NOTE:</B><EM>This feature is only available on versions of Graphviz
that are newer than mid-November 2003. In particular, it is not part
of release 1.10.</EM>
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B><EM>The font markups for bold, italic, underlining, subscript and 
superscript </EM>(<TT>&lt;B&gt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;I&gt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;U&gt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;SUB&gt</TT> and <TT>&lt;SUP&gt;</TT>) 
<EM>are only available in versions after 14 October 2011, and 
the markup for strike-through (<TT>&lt;S&gt;</TT>) requires versions later than 15 September 2013.
In addition, all of these markups are
currently only available via the cairo and svg renderers.
The horizontal and vertical rules </EM>(<TT>&lt;HR&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;VR&gt;</TT>)
<EM>are only available in versions later than 8 July 2011.  </EM>
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B><EM>For releases later than 9 September 2014, one can use </EM><TT>shape=plain</TT> <EM>so that the size
of the node is totally determined by the label. Otherwise, the node's margin, width and height values may cause the
node to be larger, so that edges are clipped away from the label. In effect, </EM><TT>shape=plain</TT> <EM>is shorthand
for </EM> <TT>shape=none width=0 height=0 margin=0</TT>.
<P>
If the value of a label attribute
(<A HREF=attrs.html#d:label><TT>label</TT></A> for nodes, edges, clusters, and
graphs, and the
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:headlabel><TT>headlabel</TT></A> and
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:taillabel><TT>taillabel</TT></A>
attributes of an edge) is given as an
<A HREF=lang.html#html>HTML string</A>, 
that is, delimited by <TT>&lt;...&gt;</TT>
rather than <TT>&quot;...&quot;</TT>,
the label is interpreted as
an HTML description. At their simplest, such labels
can describe multiple lines of variously aligned text as provided by ordinary 
<A HREF=attrs.html#k:escString>string labels</A>. More generally, the
label can specify a table similar to those provided by HTML,
with different graphical attributes at each level.
<P>
As <A HREF=lang.html#html>HTML strings</A> are processed like HTML input, any use of
the &quot;, &amp;, &lt;, and &gt; characters in literal text or in attribute values
need to be replaced by the corresponding escape sequence. For example, if you want to
use  &amp; in an <TT>href</TT> value, this should be represented as  &amp;amp;.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The features and syntax supported by these labels are
modeled on HTML. However, there are many aspects that are relevant
to Graphviz labels that are not in HTML and, conversely, HTML allows
various constructs which are meaningless in Graphviz. We will generally
refer to these labels as "HTML labels" rather than the cumbersome
"HTML-like labels" but the reader is warned that these are not really
HTML. The grammar below describes precisely what Graphviz will accept.
<P>
Although HTML labels are not, strictly speaking, a shape, they can be
viewed as a generalization of the record shapes described above. 
In particular, if a node has set its 
<A HREF=attrs.html#k:shape><TT>shape</TT></A>
attribute to <TT>none</TT> or <TT>plaintext</TT>, the HTML label will be the node's
shape. On the other hand, if the node has any other shape (except 
<TT>point</TT>), the HTML label will be embedded within the node the
same way an ordinary label would be.
<P>
The following is an abstract grammar for HTML labels.
Terminals, corresponding to elements, are shown in bold font,
and nonterminals in italics.
Square brackets [ and ] enclose optional items.
Vertical bars | separate alternatives.
Note that, as in HTML, element and attribute names are case-insensitive.
(cf. sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of the 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401">HTML 4.01 specification</A>).
