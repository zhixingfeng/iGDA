TODO for graphviz
-----------------

  * Check the dependencies for all bindings, e.g. libgv-guile doesn't seem to
    depend on any guile package.
  * The handling of the libgv-php5 package could be better. An idea would be to
    have a debian/libgv-php5.install.in file, which would be preprocessed, so
    that the appropriate path is computed at build-time (using the output of
    the “php-config5 --extension-dir” command).
  * That should really be done for all languages needing extra work,
    see debian/rules.
  * Think about putting the configuration file into /var, see the discussion
    with Alexander on the 10th of August.
  * Stop using -lstdc++ and use CXX (not trivial actually).
  * Adjust --build and --host options to ./configure so as to support cross-
    compilation correctly.
  * The Conflicts between libgv-perl and older graphviz might go away since the
    location of perl files was adapted to follow the perl policy. To be checked
    with piuparts.
  * Check and eventually refresh the package relationships (Suggests:,
    and maybe the Conflicts: towards gdtclft).
  * Tcl/Tk:
     - Check the .0.0.0 stuff for the Tcl parts. Should it be using
       “-module -avoid-version” too?
  * fontconfig results in no dependency, that might be dropped from the B-D.
