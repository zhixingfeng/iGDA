libgraphviz##SONAME##-config-update - maintain libgraphviz's configuration file


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<libgraphviz##SONAME##-config-update> B<-c>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graphviz tools are using a configuration file
(F</usr/lib/graphviz/config##SONAME##> at the moment) to get some
plugin options. This command is used in B<libgraphviz##SONAME##> and
B<libgraphviz##SONAME##-*-plugin> packages' maintainer scripts to
update this configuration file when plugins are installed, updated, or
removed.


=head1 NOTE

This tool is intended to be used only in maintainer scripts and it
shouldn't be needed to run it manually.
