The dot layout engine assumes a spline smoothing
algorithm for edges, rather than Tk's default smoothing.
So edges rendered to Tk canvas will look
better if the Tkspline extension is available.

Tkspline is available from:

	ftp://ftp.graphviz.org/pub/

For Tk prior to tk8.3.0 Jan Nijtmans' dash patches
are required by Tkspline.

Dash patches are available from:
