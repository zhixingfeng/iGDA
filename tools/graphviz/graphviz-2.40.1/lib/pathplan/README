Alpha release 5/16/98

NOTES
Makefile is for AT&T nmake, available as part of "astkit" at
	http://akpublic.research.att.com:9000/sw/tools/reuse/
	The entire build is controlled from the Makefile.

makefile is for old make (works with GNU) and employs recursive makes.
	Edit the configuration in Config.mk (for platform independent
	definitions) and makearch/$(ARCH) (for platform dependent definitions).  

The makefiles build the path planner library, and an interactive TCL/tk
front end for demos.  To run the interactive demo, the general idea is
to build visitk (an executable that contains tclsh) or Visitk.so
(a dynamic shared library that can be loaded into tclsh) and then
run path.tcl to get the demo.

The library is still being developed.  Our plan is to clean up the
internal interfaces (where data structures are copied and converted
so we could glue in some older code).  We also changed the spline
fitter router so that the output spline is not forced to hit all the
points of the input path.  We plan to extend the library interface to
let the caller determine which path points must be hit.
