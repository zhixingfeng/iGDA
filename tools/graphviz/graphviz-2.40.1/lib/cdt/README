DIRECTORY HIERARCHY:
This directory hierarchy contains the source of Cdt, the container data type library.

SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION:

There are two make files, Makefile for Glenn Fowler's nmake and
makefile for old make.  The build procedure is based on the
iffe language for automatic configuration. An iffe interpreter
and its manual pages are included in this code distribution.
See the files in ./features for examples of iffe probes to generate
configuration parameters.
