.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lneato
is a graph editor for the X Window System.  It may be run as a standalone
editor, or as a front end for applications that use graphs.  It can control
multiple windows viewing different graphs.

.B lneato
is written on top of
.B neato
and
.BR lefty .
.B lefty
is a general-purpose programmable editor for technical pictures.  It has an
interpretive programming language similar to AWK and C.  The user interface and
graph editing operations of
.B lneato
are written as
.B lefty
functions.
Programmer-defined graph operations may be loaded as well.  Graph layouts are
made by
.BR neato ,
which runs as a separate process that communicates with
.B lefty
through pipes.

If the input graph contains xdot attributes,
.B lneato
will use that to display the graph. Otherwise, it runs
.B neato
to obtain layout information.
.SH USAGE
The file name is optional. If present, the graph contained in that file is
displayed in the
.B lneato
window.
