Introduction
============

prune reads directed graphs in the same format used by dot(1) and
removes subgraphs rooted at nodes specified on the commandline via
options. These nodes themselves will not be removed, but can be given
attributes so that they can be easily located by a graph stream editor
such as gvpr(1).

dot and gvpr are part of graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org), a graph
processing software by AT&T.

Installation
============

1. Get the graphviz sources and compile them. You don't have to
   install graphviz. Make sure that you comply with the graphviz
   license terms.

2. make GRAPHVIZ_DIR=<path to graphviz directory>

3. make install

4. RTFM (Read The Fine Manual)

License Terms
=============

Prune uses components of the graphviz software by statically linking
graphviz libraries. This requires that you have to follow the graphviz
license terms on top of mine if you want to use prune. Prune's license
terms are in the source code.
