Enhancements to the dotty interface:

- Smooth scroll following mouse - activated by pressing/holding the TAB
  key down and scrolling to point where mouse pointer is.
- Add "zoom slowly" function to use , and . and follow mouse to fine-grain
  zoom in on a particular region w/ mouse panning.  'Z' and 'z'
  still work for coarse zoom, but this will pan to cursor as well.
- Add new node with 'n' key (dialog prompts for name).  This worked 
  better for me than the dual-use left mouse button.
- Add new edge with 'e' key (ditto)
- Folding option, using 'f' key over node to fold all child
  nodes into parent (folded node has "Msquare" cornered box appearance)
  , and unfold with another 'f' keypress.  Child
  nodes that are shared with another parent are not folded.
  Would like to use unique node shape, or maybe you can think of
  a better way to represent a folded node (thick border, etc?)
- Added a 'change label' menu item for node/edge menu
- Added 'Q' for quit, which prompts for save
  (will unfold any folded nodes before any save is done, since I haven't
  figured out how to encode/restore fold info to/from the graph file)
- Added save prompt for current graph on 'load graph' menu selection
- Rudimentary "hyperlink" - click on node and select "load subgraph"
  from the menu to load and display ./{nodename}.gv graph.  Can
  navigate back to immediate parent thru menu selection.
  '+' also goes to parent, '-' to subgraph of a node.  Was not able to
  store parent information in graph spec file, so a graph has to be 
  loaded as a subgraph to another graph before the "parent" feature will
  work.  Needs improvement...

To install, copy the *.lefty files here into 

  <GraphVizRoot>/lib/lefty

or before building and installing, copy the files into

  <GraphVizRoot>/src/pkg/dotty

and then build the system.
