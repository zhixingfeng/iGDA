Subject: Perl script to create .dot graphs out of directory hierarchies

Hi Stephen,

I started using dot about a year ago, and it has changed the way I am
thinking about graphs as documentation aids;  previously I tried to
avoid them, now I am looking for excuses to use a graph.  As a token
gift in return I am enclosing a small Perl script that creates dot
graphs out of directory hierarchies.  It correctly handles some tricky
parts like names with invalid characters, and the same directory name
appearing in sibling or parent nodes.  It works under Unix and Windows. 
The gzipped tar file contains the script and a few graphs I created with
it.  On the BSD and the linux kernel graphs I tuned a few parameters to
make them fit on a page.  Feel free to include whatever you see fit in
upcoming graphviz releases.

Cheers,

Diomidis
